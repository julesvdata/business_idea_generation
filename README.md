## Usage Guide

# Idea Generation

On the starting page users can generate ideas for a variety of Idea Types (New Products, Marketing Campaigns, Business Strategies or Business Models) selectable on the top menu. Here users can also customise the generated ideas by entering an industry or selecting a target gender and age. 

Users can also input a subject to customise thier ideas further (the starting example is "space exploration").

Once ideas are generated users can generate a further set of ideas by clicking the "more" button at the bottom of the current set of ideas.

Clicking on the "explore" button on any idea will take your through to the details page for that idea.
